Graph is a collection of 'Nodes' and 'Relationships'. There can be relationships between nodes for examples node named 'Person' can own a 'Car'. So this creates a relationship between 'Person' node to 'Car' node.
Properties are Key-Value paris on a Node / Relationship. Neo4j does not support nested properties.
	Example:	{
				name:'George Clooney'
			}
