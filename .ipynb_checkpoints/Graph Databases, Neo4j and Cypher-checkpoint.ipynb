    "## Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph database management system (henceforth, a graph database) is an online database management system with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) methods that expose a graph data model. Graph databases are generally built for use with transactional (OLTP) systems. Accordingly, they are normally optimized for transactional performance, and engineered with transactional integrity and operational availability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two properties of graph databases we should consider when investigating graph database technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The underlying storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some graph databases use native graph storage that is optimized and designed for storing and managing graphs. Not all graph database technologies use native graph storage, however. Some serialize the graph data into a relational database, an object-oriented database, or some other general-purpose data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The processing engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Some definitions require that a graph database use index-free adjacency, meaningthat connected nodes physically “point” to each other in the database. Here we take a slightly broader view: any database that from the user’s perspective behaves like a graph database (i.e., exposes a graph data model through CRUD operations) qualifies as a graph database. We do acknowledge, however, the significant performance advantages of index-free adjacency, and therefore use the term native graph processing to describe graph databases that leverage index-free adjacency."

    "\n",
    "Often we want to categorize the nodes in our networks according to the roles they play. Some nodes, for example, might represent users, whereas others represent orders or products. In Neo4j, we use labels to represent the roles a node plays in the\n",
    "graph. Because a node can fulfill several different roles in a graph, Neo4j allows us to add more than one label to a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using labels in this way, we can group nodes. We can ask the database, for example, to find all the nodes labeled User. (Labels also provide a hook for declaratively indexing nodes, as we shall see later.) We use labels extensively in the examples in the rest of this book. Where a node represents a user, we’ve added a User label; where it represents an order we’ve added an Order label, and so on. "

    "## The Labeled Property Graph Model\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • A labeled property graph is made up of nodes, relationships, properties, and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Nodes contain properties. Think of nodes as documents that store properties in the form of arbitrary key-value pairs. In Neo4j, the keys are strings and the values are the Java string and primitive data types, plus arrays of these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Nodes can be tagged with one or more labels. Labels group nodes together, and indicate the roles they play within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Relationships connect nodes and structure the graph. A relationship always has a direction, a single name, and a start node and an end node—there are no dangling relationships. Together, a relationship’s direction and name add semantic clarity to the structuring of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Like nodes, relationships can also have properties. The ability to add properties to relationships is particularly useful for providing additional metadata for graph algorithms, adding additional semantics to relationships (including quality and weight), and for constraining queries at runtime."

    "## Nodes for Things, Relationships for Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not applicable in every situation, these general guidelines will help us choose when to use nodes, and when to use relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Use nodes to represent entities—that is, the things in our domain that are of interest to us, and which can be labeled and grouped.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Use relationships both to express the connections between entities and to establish semantic context for each entity, thereby structuring the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Use relationship direction to further clarify relationship semantics. Many relationships are asymmetrical, which is why relationships in a property graph are always directed. For bidirectional relationships, we should make our queries ignore direction, rather than using two relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; • Use node properties to represent entity attributes, plus any necessary entity metadata, such as timestamps, version numbers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
